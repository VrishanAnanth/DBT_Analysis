# DBT_Analysis

The Dierect Bank Transfer was a scheme started by the Indian government which essentially removed middlemen in giving subsidies, grants, transfers etc.
to farmers, and the money was directly deposited in their account.

In this project, we perform a regression to see if the DBT actually helped farmers, and made them financially more stable, while controlling for factors like rain
temperature, soil quality, calamities etc.

I did this project during my internship at the Indian School of Business and the project is currently a working paper at top journals
